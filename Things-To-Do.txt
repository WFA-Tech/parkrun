Some user requests:

1) Design an auto-upgrade method - allow a user to upgrade their software via USB or Internet
2) Some kind of remote Internet debugging
3) Better error handling for stopwatch data - sometimes we get two events in a stopwatch. We will always pick event 1, it could get both in different files

Let me know if you want more!
